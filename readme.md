The goal of this project is to identify the optimal proportion of fast pass customers that the manager at an amusement park can sell on a day by retaining the satisfaction of both the regular and fast pass customers. Designed a Simio model with separate routes for regular and fast pass customers with several add-on processes including data tables, rates table, time scheduling grid, assigning statistics, balking, building sequence tables, and binding input data and experiments. Ran the simulation for 12 hours and 100 replications and computed the desired wait times for different rides and activities, the number of visitors in the park and the overall customer satisfaction for both the customer types.
